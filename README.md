# rock_the_upgrades
A SourceMod plugin for Team Fortress 2 which enables MvM upgrades on any map. The plugin enables chat commands which trigger a vote similar to the Rock the Vote sourcemod plugin. If the vote is successful, the upgrade system is activated, and each resupply locker will be modified to activate the upgrades menu when in range.
